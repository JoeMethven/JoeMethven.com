						br
						| Booket is an upcoming UK-Based booking system that allows the public to implement a system
						| on there website, the ability to cusomise the visual look and feel and to allow the public to
						| book 'availability', the system is completely flexible, allowing one user to be booking Cinema Tickets
						| whilst another books time with their personal trainer or a driving lesson!

						br
						br
						| I had designed what could be the initial front page of the website, the whole design plans to be extremely simplistic,
						| with smart features making use of the spacious areas available such as a fixed menu that transforms on scroll so the menu 
						| mixes with the white modules below, and the dropdowns propel open large clean modules without clashing with the rest of the
						| design. 
						| I tried to give specific attention to the menu, to give the effect that there isn't much there by expanding what could
						| be stuffed all on one row into multiple rows that makes it a lot easier to read for the viewer.

						| I created the logo in a way that it felt professional, kept with the calm blue colour scheme and also 
						| appears with the text so the viewer can understand the business straight away resembles booking with the
						| business terminology 'Booket' which translates to 'Book it' when pronounced. On the first 'O' I transformed
						| the standard version to a location pointer to resemble booking to be somewhere or to do something. The final
						| ending of 'et' was changed in colour to differentiate between 'book' and 'et' to help the viewer find it easier
						| in understanding the translation by emphasising book in brighter whilst pointing the 'et' extension.
